Alexis Madrigal's [5 Intriguing Things](https://tinyletter.com/intriguingthings) is a usually-daily newsletter containing links to things. This repo is the ui for a (good enough) archive of those things. The [archive](https://github.com/mobeets/intriguing-things-scraper) is updated daily, thanks to [Morph](https://morph.io).


(Note: I couldn't figure out how to use heroku to automate the scraping--thus the Morph solution. Sadly, this makes the browser slower.)
