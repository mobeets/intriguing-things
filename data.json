As cheap Chinese panels began to flood the market, [Solaris President Suvi] Sharma was under pressure to lower his own costs. In 2010, he began to search for glass suppliers in China. A layer of flat glass, attached at either end of the panel, can improve photovoltaic efficiency and protect panels from harsh weather.

For that, it was going to need to need to produce panels in China directly. Oddly, the same trade dispute that was dividing China and the U.S. provided an opening for Solaria. This past September, China began retaliating against U.S. tariffs by slapping duties on U.S.-made polysilicon imports \u2013 a key ingredient in solar panels. As a result, manufacturing costs soared for many Chinese panel makers. Solaria\u2019s technology, however, uses significantly less silicon in making its panels.

An easy to use strategy to defeat all such chatbots in a Turing Test is simply to send them an obvious ASCII art image, and then ask them to answer questions about it. All conversation based chatbots will fail to answer relevant questions about a transmitted image because the software can not see the image and can not generate any internal representation of it. Chatbots will be forced to use evasion and distraction to avoid answering questions about an image whereas humans will be able to respond immediately and correctly.\"</p>", "<p>&nbsp;</p>"], "src_url": "http://tinyletter.com/intriguingthings/letters/5-intriguing-things-141", "number": 3, "title": "Hey, good point: It's easy to separate human from machine in a Turing test with the use of ASCII art"}, {"url": "http://opencog.org/", "ps": ["<p>\"OpenCog&nbsp;is an open-source software project aimed at directly confronting the AGI challenge, using mathematical and biological inspiration and professional software engineering techniques.
